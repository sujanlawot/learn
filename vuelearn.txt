1.  $index in v-for
    track-by tells Vue which aspect of each item is unique, so it can know when to re-use DOM elements.
    If your array is a series of objects with an id attribute, you can use track-by='id' . 
    But if the objects don't have a unique field, track-by='$index' associates each object with its position in the array.

3. Routing 
    a. template 
        v-link="{ name: 'holiday-form', query: { dateFlag: true }}"
        dateFlag:this.$route.query.dateFlag?true:false,
    b. method
        this.$router.go("/holiday-schedule");


4. On change of selected_item_name.team_item the teamItemDetail does not get change
    that.teamItemDetail.team_item = that._.clone(that.selected_item_name.team_item);

5.<router-link
                :to="{ name: 'voucherContra' }"
                class="nav-link"
                exact
              >
exact => 
<router-link to="/a"> will get this class applied as long as the current path starts with /a/ or is /a.
One consequence of this is that <router-link to="/"> will be active for every route! To force the link into "exact match mode"
